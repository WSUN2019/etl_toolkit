# :wrench: ETL & Folder Tools Sandbox

A collection of **ETL and folder management tools** written in Python.  
I use **Streamlit** to host it as a web app, making it easier to interact with and explore the tools.

**Created:** 1/31/2026 — WSUN

## :computer: About This Sandbox

This repository is my personal **sandbox** to practice and experiment with integrating different technologies:

1. **GitHub** – version control and collaboration  
2. **Python** – scripting, ETL processes, and automation  
3. **Windows OS** – file system management and folder automation  

The goal is to learn, explore, and create small tools that can be used and tested easily through a web interface.
